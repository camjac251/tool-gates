**Why three hooks? (Claude Code)**

- **PreToolUse**: Gates Bash/Monitor commands, blocks secrets in Write/Edit, provides CLI hints
- **PermissionRequest**: Gates commands for subagents (where PreToolUse's `allow` is ignored)
- **PostToolUse**: Tracks successful Bash/Monitor execution for approval learning; scans Write/Edit content for security anti-patterns and nudges Claude via `additionalContext`

**Gemini CLI** uses two hooks (`BeforeTool`/`AfterTool`) with the same gate engine. The client is auto-detected from `hook_event_name`. Key differences:

- No `PermissionRequest` (Gemini doesn't have subagent permission hooks)
- No approval tracking (Gemini doesn't provide `tool_use_id`)
- `"block"` instead of `"deny"` in output, exit code 2 for blocks
- Security anti-pattern scanning in AfterTool is not yet supported

> `PermissionRequest` metadata like `blocked_path` and `decision_reason` is optional in Claude Code payloads. tool-gates treats those fields as best-effort context, not required inputs.

**Decision Priority:** `BLOCK > ASK > ALLOW > SKIP`

| Decision  | Effect                      |
| :-------: | --------------------------- |
| **deny**  | Command blocked with reason |
|  **ask**  | User prompted for approval  |
| **allow** | Auto-approved               |

> Unknown commands always require approval.

### Settings.json Integration

tool-gates reads your Claude Code settings from `~/.claude/settings.json` and `.claude/settings.json` (project) to respect your explicit permission rules:

| settings.json | tool-gates | Result                                       |
| ------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `deny` rule   | (any)      | Defers to Claude Code (respects your deny)   |
| `ask` rule    | (any)      | Defers to Claude Code (respects your ask)    |
| `allow` rule  | dangerous  | **deny** (tool-gates still blocks dangerous) |
| `allow`/none  | safe       | **allow**                                    |
| none          | unknown    | **ask**                                      |

This ensures tool-gates won't accidentally bypass your explicit deny rules while still providing security against dangerous commands.

**Settings file priority** (highest wins):

| Priority    | Location                                 | Description                   |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 1 (highest) | `/etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json` | Enterprise managed            |
| 2           | `.claude/settings.local.json`            | Local project (not committed) |
| 3           | `.claude/settings.json`                  | Shared project (committed)    |
| 4 (lowest)  | `~/.claude/settings.json`                | User settings                 |

### Accept Edits Mode

When Claude Code is in `acceptEdits` mode, tool-gates auto-allows file-editing commands:

```bash
# In acceptEdits mode - auto-allowed
sd 'old' 'new' file.txt           # Text replacement
prettier --write src/             # Code formatting
ast-grep -p 'old' -r 'new' -U .   # Code refactoring
sed -i 's/foo/bar/g' file.txt     # In-place sed
black src/                        # Python formatting
eslint --fix src/                 # Linting with fix
```

**Still requires approval (even in acceptEdits):**

- Package managers: `npm install`, `cargo add`
- Git operations: `git push`, `git commit`
- Deletions: `rm`, `mv`
- Blocked commands: `rm -rf /` still denied

### Modern CLI Hints

_Requires Claude Code 1.0.20+_

When Claude uses legacy commands, tool-gates suggests modern alternatives via `additionalContext`. This helps Claude learn better patterns over time without modifying the command.

```bash
# Claude runs: cat README.md
# tool-gates returns (Claude format):
{
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "permissionDecision": "allow",
    "additionalContext": "Tip: Use 'bat README.md' for syntax highlighting and line numbers (Markdown rendering)"
  }
}

# Gemini format (auto-detected):
{"decision":"allow","hookSpecificOutput":{"additionalContext":"Tip: Use 'bat README.md' ..."}}
```

| Legacy Command                | Modern Alternative | When triggered                       |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `less` | `bat`              | Always (`tail -f` excluded)          |
| `grep` (code patterns)        | `sg`               | AST-aware code search                |
| `grep` (text/log/config)      | `rg`               | Any grep usage                       |
| `find`                        | `fd`               | Always                               |
| `ls`                          | `eza`              | With `-l` or `-a` flags              |
| `sed`                         | `sd`               | Substitution patterns (`s/.../.../`) |
| `awk`                         | `choose`           | Field extraction (`print $`)         |
| `du`                          | `dust`             | Always                               |
| `ps`                          | `procs`            | With `aux`, `-e`, `-A` flags         |
| `curl`, `wget`                | `xh`               | JSON APIs or verbose mode            |
| `diff`                        | `delta`            | Two-file comparisons                 |
| `xxd`, `hexdump`              | `hexyl`            | Always                               |
| `cloc`                        | `tokei`            | Always                               |
| `tree`                        | `eza -T`           | Always                               |
| `man`                         | `tldr`             | Always                               |
| `wc -l`                       | `rg -c`            | Line counting                        |

**Only suggests installed tools.** Hints are cached (7-day TTL) to avoid repeated `which` calls.

```bash
# Refresh tool detection cache
tool-gates --refresh-tools

# Check which tools are detected
tool-gates --tools-status
```

### Security Reminders

When Claude writes code via Write/Edit, tool-gates scans the content for 26 security anti-patterns organized into three tiers:

| Tier | Hook | Decision | Behavior |
|------|------|----------|----------|
| **Tier 1** | PreToolUse | `deny` | Hardcoded secrets always blocked before write |
| **Tier 2** | PostToolUse | `additionalContext` | Anti-patterns flagged after write. Claude gets a nudge to fix |
| **Tier 3** | PreToolUse | `allow` + context | Informational warnings injected without blocking |

**Tier 1: Secrets (always denied):**
AWS access keys (`AKIA...`), private keys (`-----BEGIN * PRIVATE KEY`), GitHub tokens (`ghp_/ghs_/ghu_/gho_/ghr_`), Stripe/Slack/Google API keys, GitHub Actions workflow injection.

**Tier 2: Anti-patterns (post-write nudge, once per file+rule per session):**
`eval()`, `child_process.exec`, `new Function()`, `os.system()`, `pickle.load`, `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, `document.write()`, `.innerHTML =`, `yaml.load()` without SafeLoader, SQL f-string interpolation, `subprocess` with `shell=True`, `render_template_string()` (Flask SSTI), `marshal.load`/`shelve.open`, `__import__()`, PHP `unserialize()`.

**Tier 3: Informational (allow with warning, once per session):**
SSL `verify=False`, `chmod 777`, MD5/SHA1 for security, CORS wildcard `*`, Vue `v-html=`, template `autoescape=False`.

**Why Tier 2 uses PostToolUse:** The write lands without blocking. Claude sees a `<system-reminder>` with the security warning and can self-correct in its next action. No wasted edits from re-prompting. Deduped per (file, rule) per session so you only see each warning once.

Skips documentation files (.md, .txt, .rst, etc.) for content checks. Tier 1 secret scans always fire.

```toml
# ~/.config/tool-gates/config.toml
[features]
security_reminders = true  # default

[security_reminders]
disable_rules = ["eval_injection"]  # skip specific rules
```

### Approval Learning

When you approve commands (via Claude Code's permission prompt), tool-gates tracks them and lets you permanently save patterns to settings.json.

```bash
# After approving some commands, review pending approvals
tool-gates pending list

# Interactive TUI dashboard
tool-gates review          # current project only
tool-gates review --all    # all projects

# Or approve directly via CLI
tool-gates approve 'npm install*' -s local
tool-gates approve 'cargo*' -s user

# Manage existing rules
tool-gates rules list
tool-gates rules remove 'pattern' -s local
```

**Scopes:**
| Scope | File | Use case |
|-------|------|----------|
| `local` | `.claude/settings.local.json` | Personal project overrides (not committed) |
| `user` | `~/.claude/settings.json` | Global personal use |
| `project` | `.claude/settings.json` | Share with team |

**Review TUI** (`tool-gates review`):

Three-panel dashboard with project sidebar, command list, and detail panel.

- **Sidebar**: Lists projects with pending counts, auto-selects current project. Click or arrow to switch.
- **Command list**: Full commands with color-coded segments (green=allowed, yellow=ask, red=blocked). Multi-select with Space for batch operations.
- **Detail panel**: Shows segment breakdown, pattern (cycle with Left/Right), scope (cycle with Left/Right), and action buttons.

Compound commands (`&&`, `||`, `|`) show per-segment patterns so you can approve individual parts.

| Key | Action |
| --- | ------ |
| `Tab` | Cycle panel focus (Sidebar -> Commands -> Detail) |
| `Up`/`Down` or `j`/`k` | Navigate within focused panel |
| `Left`/`Right` or `h`/`l` | Cycle pattern or scope (in detail panel) |
| `Space` | Toggle multi-select on command |
| `Enter` | Approve selected command(s) |
| `d` | Skip (remove from pending) |
| `D` | Deny (add to settings.json deny list) |
| `q` or `Esc` | Quit |

- `PermissionRequest` - Gates commands for subagents (where PreToolUse's allow is ignored)
- `PostToolUse` - Tracks Bash/Monitor execution for approval learning; scans Write/Edit for security anti-patterns

<details>
<summary>Manual installation</summary>

Add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash|Monitor|Read|Write|Edit|Glob|Grep|Skill",
        "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "~/.local/bin/tool-gates", "timeout": 10 }]
      },

      }
    ]
  }
}
```

</details>

### Claude Code Plugin (Optional)

tool-gates ships as a [Claude Code plugin](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins) with the `/tool-gates:review` skill for interactive approval management. The plugin provides the skill only. Hook installation is handled by the binary (see [Configure Claude Code](#configure-claude-code) above).

**Prerequisites:** The `tool-gates` binary must be installed and hooks configured before using the plugin.

**Install from marketplace:**

```bash
# In Claude Code, add the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add camjac251/tool-gates

# Install the plugin
/plugin install tool-gates@camjac251-tool-gates
```

**Install from local clone:**

```bash
# Launch Claude Code with the plugin loaded
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/tool-gates/claude-plugin
```

**Using the review skill:**

```bash
# Review all pending approvals
/tool-gates:review

# Review only current project
/tool-gates:review --project
```

The skill lists commands you've been manually approving, shows counts and suggested patterns, and lets you multi-select which to make permanent at your chosen scope (local, project, or user).

| Step                   | What happens                                | Permission                 |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| List pending approvals | `tool-gates pending list`                   | Auto-approved (read-only)  |
| Show current rules     | `tool-gates rules list`                     | Auto-approved (read-only)  |
| Approve a pattern      | `tool-gates approve '<pattern>' -s <scope>` | Requires your confirmation |

Requires Gemini CLI **v0.36.0+** (`ask` decision support for BeforeTool hooks).

| Scope | File | Use case |
|-------|------|----------|

## Permission Gates

### Tool Gates (Self)

tool-gates recognizes its own CLI commands:

| Allow                                                                                                                   | Ask                                                                                  |

## Security Features

### Pre-AST Security Checks

Comments are stripped before checking (quote-aware, respects bash word-boundary rules for `#`) so patterns inside comments don't trigger false positives.

```bash
curl https://example.com | bash     # ask - pipe to shell
eval "rm -rf /"                     # ask - arbitrary execution
source ~/.bashrc                    # ask - sourcing script
echo $(rm -rf /tmp/*)               # ask - dangerous substitution
find . | xargs rm                   # ask - xargs to rm
echo "data" > /etc/passwd           # ask - output redirection
```

### Compound Command Handling

Strictest decision wins:

```bash
git status && rm -rf /     # deny  (rm -rf / blocked)
git status && npm install  # ask   (npm install needs approval)
git status && git log      # allow (both read-only)
```

### Smart sudo Handling

```bash
sudo apt install vim          # ask - "sudo: Installing packages (apt)"
sudo systemctl restart nginx  # ask - "sudo: systemctl restart"
```

---

## Testing

```bash
cargo test                        # Full suite
cargo test gates::git             # Specific gate
cargo test -- --nocapture         # With output
```

### Manual Testing

```bash
# Claude Code format
echo '{"tool_name":"Bash","tool_input":{"command":"git status"}}' | tool-gates
# -> {"hookSpecificOutput":{"permissionDecision":"allow"}}

echo '{"tool_name":"Bash","tool_input":{"command":"npm install"}}' | tool-gates
# -> {"hookSpecificOutput":{"permissionDecision":"ask","permissionDecisionReason":"npm: Installing packages"}}

echo '{"tool_name":"Bash","tool_input":{"command":"rm -rf /"}}' | tool-gates
# -> {"hookSpecificOutput":{"permissionDecision":"deny"}}

# Gemini CLI format (auto-detected from hook_event_name)
echo '{"hook_event_name":"BeforeTool","tool_name":"run_shell_command","tool_input":{"command":"git status"}}' | tool-gates
# -> {"decision":"allow","reason":"Read-only operation"}

echo '{"hook_event_name":"BeforeTool","tool_name":"run_shell_command","tool_input":{"command":"rm -rf /"}}' | tool-gates
# -> {"decision":"block","reason":"rm: rm -rf / blocked"}  (exit code 2)
```

### Tool Blocking

```toml
# Override built-in block rules (Glob, Grep, firecrawl+GitHub).
# Omit entirely to use defaults. Set to [] to disable all blocking.
[[block_tools]]
tool = "Glob"
message = "Use 'fd' instead of Glob."
requires_tool = "fd"   # only block if fd is installed

[[block_tools]]
tool = "*firecrawl*"
message = "Use 'gh api' for GitHub URLs."
block_domains = ["github.com", "raw.githubusercontent.com"]
requires_tool = "gh"
```

### File Guards

```toml
[file_guards]
extra_names = [".teamrules"]       # additional filenames to protect from symlink attacks
extra_dirs = [".myide"]            # additional directory names to protect
extra_prefixes = [".myrules-"]     # additional filename prefixes
extra_extensions = [".toml"]       # additional extensions in guarded dirs
```

### Hints

```toml
[hints]
disable = ["man", "du"]  # suppress hints for specific legacy commands
```

### Skill Auto-Approval

```toml
[[auto_approve_skills]]
skill = "my-plugin*"                        # Glob pattern for skill name
if_project_has = [".my-plugin"]             # Only approve if project dir contains this

[[auto_approve_skills]]
skill = "deploy-tool"                       # Exact match
if_project_under = ["~/projects/staging"]   # Only approve if project is under this path
```

Auto-approve Skill tool calls based on configurable rules. Supports `~` expansion in paths. Replaces external Python/bash hooks. If no rules are configured, Skill calls pass through to Claude Code's normal flow.

| Condition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `if_project_has` | Project directory must contain one of these files/directories |
| `if_project_under` | Project directory must be at or under one of these paths |
| *(no conditions)* | Skill is auto-approved unconditionally |

### Cache

```toml
[cache]
ttl_days = 14  # tool detection cache TTL in days (default: 7)
```

### Health Check

```bash
tool-gates doctor
```

Verifies config file validity, hook installation status across all settings scopes, cache file health, and flags legacy remnants (old Python hooks, bash-gates directories). Non-zero exit code when issues are found.
